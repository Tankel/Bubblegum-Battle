# Bubblegum-Battle
## Description
This is a video game made in cocos2dx. It is a cuphead-style 2d game, where you fight against bosses with different abilities, and you can also acquire powerups during the game. Unfortunately it only has 3 levels.

## Clarifications 
This was made for my advanced programming class as my final project, so it was actually my first video game made in cocos2dx or in any other framework of this style
All the sprites were made completely by me in the pixelart style.
The music and sound effects are free to use, they were taken from web pages and youtube videos where the authors authorize their permission.
